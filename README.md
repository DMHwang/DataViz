# Visualization of European Airbnb
#### IDC 5112: Data Visualization

Paul Hwang

## Project Overview

We will be making visualization of Airbnb data. The data is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipeshkhemani/airbnb-cleaned-europe-dataset), and we will present some interesting findings regarding Airbnb in Europe using Shiny (https://phwang.shinyapps.io/final_project/)


## Project Summary

This visualization attempts to give a general summary of Airbnbs in Europe and talk about some of the interesting characteristics. One interesting find is that price is barely correlated with factors not directly related to the room itself. Though price seemed to go up as the room size and satisfaction rating went up, price seemed to be weakly, if at all, correlated with distance to city center or attraction ratings. On the other hand, attraction index is strongly correlated with a good number of factors. Any factors that are not price, the number of bedrooms, or people capacity have some correlation with attraction index. For example, closer the Airbnb is to city center, the higher the attraction index is.
